# Obstacle-Detection-and-Alert-System-using-an-Ultrasonic-Radar
This is Arduino-based project uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on an MG995 servo motor to scan the area like a radar and measure distances. When an obstacle enters the set range, a buzzer provides an instant alert. The Processing GUI shows real-time radar sweeps and detected objects, making the system easy to monitor and affordable.
