🛰️ OBSTACLE DETECTION and ALERT SYSTEM using an ULTRASONIC RADAR

📌 Project Overview :-
This project is an Obstacle Detection and Alert System that uses an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a rotating servo motor to scan the surroundings. The data is sent to a Processing GUI, which displays a live radar view. A buzzer gives an alert when an object is detected very close.
